<h2>About Genevieve's Notes</h2>

<p class="lead">
  Genevieve also allows users to create or edit shared notes, to augment
  ClinVar data.

<h3 id="whynotes">Why have notes?</h3>

<p>
  Sometimes the database information for a reported effect is
  confusing or clearly incorrect. It might lack important details
  (e.g. "recessive or dominant?"). There might be literature that's
  helpful to know about. Notes are a simple supplement that help
  improve information about a variant.
</p>
<p>
  Notes also create consensus. Notes are unified: there should only be one
  note for an effect, and everyone can see and edit the same note.
</p>

<h3 id="whatinfo">What information is in a note?</h3>

<p>
  Each note relates to a reported effect. If a single variant is reported to
  have different effects, these should be different notes.
</p>

<p>
  Each note contains the following fields:
</p>

<table class="table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <td>
        <b>The name of the disease or trait.</b> (required)
        <p>
          This might be identical to the condition name a ClinVar record has
          reported. If there is no "name" for an effect, this should be a
          brief description (e.g. "blue or gray eyes").
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Category</th>
      <td>
        <p>
          <b>Disease</b> (default), <b>Trait</b>, or <b>Other</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The default is to classify a new effect as a "disease", but some
          effects are not considered diseases.
        </p>
        <p>
          In reports this note field isn't separately reported. It affects
          how the "name" field is displayed (i.e. as a "disease" or "trait").
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Inheritance</th>
      <td>
        <p>
          <b>Dominant</b>, <b>Recessive</b>, <b>Additive</b>, or <b>Unknown or Other</b> (Default)
        </p>
        <p>
          A dominant effect impacts all carriers. A recessive
          effect only occurs when all copies of the gene are affected
          (e.g. if someone is "homozygous"). X-linked diseases should be
          classified as recessive. An "additive" effect impacts all carriers,
          but the effect is stronger when both copies of the gene are affected.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Significance</th>
      <td>
        <p>
          <b>Causal</b> (default), <b>Risk factor</b>, or <b>Protective</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The default ("causal") describes effects that are typically considered
          hereditary genetic diseases, i.e. "this variant causes this disease".
          If a reported effect is instead a small or moderate increased risk,
          it's a "risk factor". A reported effect that decreases risk is
          "protective".
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Evidence</th>
      <td>
        <p>
          <b>Well-established</b>, <b>Reported</b> (default), <b>Contradicted</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          This category describes the strength of evidence for this effect.
          All effects are, by default, "reported". If an effect is clearly not
          true, then it may be re-classified as "contradicted". On the other
          hand, if an effect is clearly validated through numerous publications
          or reporting sources, it may be re-classified as "well-established".
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>ClinVar records</th>
      <td>
        <p>
          <b>ClinVar records related to this reported effect.</b> (optional)
        </p>
        <p>
          All ClinVar records for this variant that relate to this reported
          effect.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Notes</th>
      <td>
        <p>
          <b>Additional notes about the effect.</b> (optional)
        </p>
        <p>
          A Markdown-formatted free text field to add more information. For
          effects re-classified as "well-established" or "contradicted", this
          section would typically contain an explanation for this
          re-classification.

<h3 id="howadd">How to add and edit notes</h3>

<p>You need a connected GenNotes account to create or edit notes.</p>

<p>
  Notes you create or edit will be edits submitted on your behalf. All notes
  are public domain. Also, although it's not currently visible in Genevieve,
  the GenNotes username associated with an edit will be considered publicly
  shareable information.
</p>

{% if request.user.gennoteseditor %}
<div class="well well-sm">
  <b>Account connected.</b>
  This account is connected to the GenNotes account for
      "{{ request.user.gennoteseditor.gennotes_username }}".
</div>

{% else %}
<p>
  To create a connected GenNotes account...
</p>

<ol style="margin-bottom:20px;">
  <li><a href="{{ gennotes_signup_url }}">Create a GenNotes account</a>.</li>
  <li>Verify the email for that account.</li>
  <li>
    If you already have an Open Humans account, make sure you're already
    logged in to it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click the button below to connect and authorize note submission.
    You'll be returned to the Genevieve home page after connecting.<br>

<h4>Note-taking tips</h4>

<p>
  <b>Defaults values are good.</b>
  If you're not sure what to pick, the default is a safe choice.
  Almost every field has a default value.
</p>

<p>
  <b>It's fine to skip the text notes.</b> For example, you might just want
  to note whether a reported effect is dominant or recessive.
